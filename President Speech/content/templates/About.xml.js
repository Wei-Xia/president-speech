    <description>    
The IBM Agile Academy is a cross-IBM Agile center of learning and capability development to create a shared understanding of Agile at IBM. We will do this by providing training and coaching to help IBMers grow their skills, a framework for measuring our maturity, and this community as a means to IBMers to support each other in their journey to become agile. The Agile Academy is built on three core Agile principles:

Our Agile Principles:
1. Begin with clarity about the outcome, and let it guide every step along the way
2. Listen, iterate, learn and course correct rather than wait until it's perfect
3. Encourage self-direction for teams to unleash innovation, instead of concentrating leadership in the hands of a select few
