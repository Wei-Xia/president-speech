    <description>    
1. Access to, and use of, IBM’s intranet
      The IBM intranet is accessible to IBM employees and other individuals authorized by IBM to access it.
      The IBM intranet is proprietary to IBM and is intended for use by IBM employees and other authorized individuals for IBM business purposes, including for locating resources, facilitating employee communications and collaboration, understanding organizational structure (including reporting structure), identifying skills and for other legal, tax, regulatory or management purposes. IBM may analyze and use for its business purposes information (such as use statistics) regarding your use of IBM’s intranet.
      Use of IBM’s systems is restricted to management approved purposes and subject to all applicable IBM policies and guidelines, including the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines, Security and Use Standards for IBM Employees (ITCS 300), IBM's Social Computing Guidelines and IBM's Guidelines for the Protection of Employee Information. Failure to follow applicable policies, guidelines and practices when using IBM’s systems may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge for IBM employees or other action which IBM in its sole discretion deems appropriate for non-IBM employees.

2. IBM Content and User Content
      There are generally two categories of content on the IBM intranet: IBM Content and User Content. IBM Content consists of the information, materials and content that is posted on the intranet by IBM itself (for example, relevant articles, resources on the Career &amp; Life tab, Corporate Instructions and policies). For information regarding how to appropriately handle IBM proprietary information (including IBM Confidential information), see Corporate Instruction Legal 116 and the accompanying Frequently Asked Questions.
      User Content is the content that employees and other authorized users post in social media applications or other environments on the IBM intranet, which would include, for example, certain profile and contact data, personal information, submissions, ideas, tags, messages, recommendations, photos, music, posts, comments, responses and other information that a user posts or uploads on IBM’s intranet.

3. Use of IBM Content and software, applications and tools made available by IBM
      The IBM intranet makes available to users a wide variety of software, tools and applications, some of which are IBM-owned and others that are owned by third parties. IBM Content and all software, tools and applications on the IBM intranet, including, for example, those available for download on ISSI or use through Technology Adoption Program (TAP), are for use by IBM employees and other authorized individuals for IBM business purposes only.

4. Social media and User Content
      IBM’s intranet provides numerous opportunities for social computing through blogs, wikis, social networks, virtual worlds and other social media. You are personally responsible for the User Content you post on any social computing application on IBM’s intranet), and you should be aware that any your User Content, including any personal information about yourself, may be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside IBM, who have access to these social media applications.
      IBM and other participants may use the User Content that you post for business purposes, may create derivative works of your User Content and may sublicense others to do the same. You agree to only post User Content that you created or developed or that you have permission or authorization to post, including personal information about others.
      IBM may, in its sole discretion, access, delete, edit or remove any User Content, without permission of or notification to the person who posted it. IBM may (but is not obligated to) monitor the activities and postings on the intranet (or be alerted to the same) for any reason. If you remove your User Content, your User Content may no longer be displayed, but IBM may, if it so chooses, archive, retain and continue to use (as provided above) your User Content. IBM is not responsible for User Content or the accuracy or correctness of such content.
      You agree that your User Content, as well as statistics and other information regarding your usage of social media tools on IBM’s intranet, may be analyzed by IBM and used for its business purposes, including without limitation, to articulate relationships among users, to identify subject matter experts, to improve existing technologies and innovate new ones and to make recommendations of information that might be useful to you.
      Do not post any User Content on any social computing tool or platform that you would not want to be made publicly available. Do not post sensitive personal information about yourself or others on any social computing tool or platform. Through IBM’s intranet, you may have access to personal information of others. You may only use and disclose that information as permitted by IBM policies or practices. Do not post third party materials without permission from the owner of that material. In addition, neither IBM Confidential information nor confidential information belonging to a third party that has been entrusted to us should be posted on the IBM intranet without access restrictions. See Corporate Instruction Legal 116 "Classification and Control of IBM information."

5. Personal information
      To the extent permitted by law, IBM and IBM authorized companies and individuals collect and maintain personal information which relates to your employment. IBM makes available on the IBM intranet certain personal information about you, such as your name, photo, contact information and career development and skills. You agree that, in connection with its business purposes, IBM (or authorized service providers on IBM’s behalf) may collect, use, store, transfer and otherwise make available on the IBM intranet such personal information about you, as well as the User Content you may post.
      As a globally integrated enterprise, IBM’s business processes, management structures and technical systems cross country borders. You acknowledge that, to run its business and as permitted by law, IBM and its authorized companies may transfer personal information about you as an IBM employee (and your User Content) to any of the countries where we do business. While not all countries have data protection laws, IBM has worldwide policies that are intended to protect information wherever it is stored or processed.
      You also agree that IBM may include business contact information about you, such as your name, title, and contact information, on IBM's external employee directory on www.ibm.com and on other IBM sites which may be established from time to time. Instructions for how to unlist from the employee directory on www.ibm.com can be found at https://w3-03.ibm.com/tools/whois/unlisted.html, and instructions for how to unlist from other sites that may be established will be included on such sites.
      We may also use, disclose or share your personal information or User Content to protect the rights or property of IBM, our business partners, suppliers, clients or others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose such information as required by law, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on IBM.

6. General
      IBM may change these Terms of Use at any time. IBM will give notice of material changes to these Terms of Use by posting a notice outlining such changes on this site for thirty days. Certain applications, tools or software found on IBM’s intranet may be subject to different or additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and the terms and conditions specific to a particular application, tool or software, the specific terms and conditions to the application, tool or software will prevail.
