        1. Access to, and use of, IBM’s intranet
        The IBM intranet is accessible to IBM employees and other individuals authorized by IBM to access it.
        The IBM intranet is proprietary to IBM and is intended for use by IBM employees and other authorized individuals for IBM business purposes, including for locating resources, facilitating employee communications and collaboration, understanding organizational structure (including reporting structure), identifying skills and for other legal, tax, regulatory or management purposes. IBM may analyze and use for its business purposes information (such as use statistics) regarding your use of IBM’s intranet.
        Use of IBM’s systems is restricted to management approved purposes and subject to all applicable IBM policies and guidelines, including the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines, Security and Use Standards for IBM Employees (ITCS 300), IBM's Social Computing Guidelines and IBM's Guidelines for the Protection of Employee Information. Failure to follow applicable policies, guidelines and practices when using IBM’s systems may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge for IBM employees or other action which IBM in its sole discretion deems appropriate for non-IBM employees.
        2. IBM Content and User Content
        There are generally two categories of content on the IBM intranet: IBM Content and User Content. IBM Content consists of the information, materials and content that is posted on the intranet by IBM itself (for example, relevant articles, resources on the Career &amp; Life tab, Corporate Instructions and policies). For information regarding how to appropriately handle IBM proprietary information (including IBM Confidential information), see Corporate Instruction Legal 116 and the accompanying Frequently Asked Questions.
        User Content is the content that employees and other authorized users post in social media applications or other environments on the IBM intranet, which would include, for example, certain profile and contact data, personal information, submissions, ideas, tags, messages, recommendations, photos, music, posts, comments, responses and other information that a user posts or uploads on IBM’s intranet.
